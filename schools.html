  <h2> Ana Colón-García </h2>
  <h3> December 16, 2024 </h3>

<p> In 2022, two organizations – <a href="https://elpuenteelacpr.org/"> El Puente Puerto Rico </a>  and the <a href="https://centropr.hunter.cuny.edu/"> Center for Puerto Rican Studies </a> – visited over 1,400 public school campuses on the island that had been classified as open in a list provided by the Department of Education for the 2011-2012 school year, in order to get a better idea of the state of schools in Puerto Rico one decade later. </p>
 
 <p> The <a href="https://cunycis.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=c54fb3d23c364dffb7592b592a40734b"> study </a> found that around 30% of schools – across all 78 municipalities – had been closed since 2011. A little over half of these closed schools were in rural areas. </p>

<p> Even though San Juan had most of the school closings (134), the most school closings per capita were (in order): Maricao, Culebra, Vieques, Patillas, and Guánica. The school with the most school closings per capita is also the municipality with the lowest per capita per income, with <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/a2683bfa7dae43749b28d0e863070f25"> more than 60% </a> of their population lives below the poverty level. </p>

<p> Public schools on the island were particularly affected by Hurricanes Irma and María in 2017. According to a 2019 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/12/magazine/puerto-rico-schools-hurricane-maria.html"> article <a/>, Puerto Rico’s Secretary of Education at the time, Julia Keleher, “shut down hundreds of still-functioning public schools” during this post-hurricane period. She is also known to have pushed for semi-privatized charter schools, which appear as more than 10% of schools in the 2022 study as “repossessed by private organizations of different types.” </p>

<p> The number of students in the Department of Education has <a href="https://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/gobierno/notas/yanira-raices-sobre-el-cierre-de-escuelas-la-recomendacion-es-hacer-una-mejor-distribucion/"> decreased by 50% </a> since 2011. The current Secretary of Education, Yanira Raíces, has said that, though she does not foresee more school closings, there is a need for a “redistribution” due to low enrollment levels.
